## Notes

MOTHNODE_ Bow Before The Sun (prod. metlast) / Raw Prototype

/// Cinematic Narrative Universe of @hitechcrime | Audiovisual Microlabel⁣⁣
⁣⁣
/// DIRECTOR OPERATIVE_ @mothnode⁣⁣
⁣⁣
/// Trying a different style. Video made with 2 LED lamps and a physical diffuser, no effects other than red color were applied. Audio recorded raw on a phone with more of a freestyle approach. Original video has a classic wide cinematic format but was cropped due to Instagram limitations.⁣
⁣
/// Lore: “Bow Before The Sun” song’s ritualistic undertones take the metaphor of light as the energy people bring into our lives, be it positive or negative. For some of us energy of either kind needs to be balanced with solitude as the social residue always puts weight on our scales. Once the scale is tipped too hard we often become blind and let others take over our emotions and perceptions of reality. Overzealous thoughts of the night time sprawl the mindscape and we can only wait till the rising brightness illuminates our lives with potential hope for yet another day.

bow before the sun⁣⁣
bow your head before the sun⁣⁣
⁣
i’ve grown so weak⁣
bound to promise⁣⁣
i wanted to keep⁣⁣
our days are bleak⁣⁣
remember how to breath⁣⁣
i’ve known good people⁣⁣
till they turned on me⁣⁣
seeking morning bright⁣⁣
seeing all, feeling all too much ⁣⁣
till we see the sun⁣⁣
⁣darkness in my mind⁣⁣
strength from words I tell⁣⁣
myself are lies⁣⁣
⁣i lay my head ⁣⁣
need to rest again⁣⁣
need to rest again⁣⁣
till we see the sun⁣
till we see the sun⁣

bow before the sun⁣⁣
